## Database Setup

1. In the NetBeans project directory (`retoConnect/sql`), locate the file **`ExamDB.sql`**.
2. Open this file in **MySQL Workbench** and run it. This will create the database and insert the initial data.
3. After that, configure the **`configClase.properties`** file, which can be found in the same directory.
